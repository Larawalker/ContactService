Ensuring Software is Functional and Secure

Functional Validation:
Requirements Analysis: Clearly define what the software must accomplish.
Unit Testing: Use frameworks like JUnit (for Java) to verify individual components.
Integration Testing: Ensure that different modules interact correctly.
System Testing: Test the complete system to validate user requirements.
User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Get feedback from end users to confirm the system meets expectations.

Security Measures:
Code Reviews: Conduct peer reviews to catch vulnerabilities early.
Input Validation: Prevent SQL injections and XSS attacks by sanitizing inputs.
Authentication & Authorization: Implement secure authentication.
Data Encryption: Encrypt sensitive data both in transit and at rest.
Security Testing: Use penetration testing tools.

User Research:
Conduct interviews, surveys, and usability testing to gather insights.
Identify pain points and desired features from users.

Requirement Analysis:
Document functional and non-functional requirements.
Prioritize features using MoSCoW method.

Prototyping and Feedback:
Create wireframes or mockups using tools like Figma.
Develop a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and gather user feedback.
Iterate based on feedback to refine functionalities.
Approaching Software Design

Selecting Technology Stack:
Choose programming languages and frameworks based on project needs.
Consider scalability and maintainability.

Developing and Iterating:
Implement features in sprints (Agile methodology).

Testing and Deployment:
Use CI/CD pipelines to automate testing and deployment.
Deploy using cloud services for scalability.
